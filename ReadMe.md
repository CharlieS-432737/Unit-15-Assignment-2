This is my submission for Unit 15 Assignment 2

The site can be launched by opening a terminal in the src folder. Once a terminal has launched run the following commands:

```bash
    npm install
    npm run dev
```

Or you can visit the site on Cloudflare using this link: <https://unit-15-assignment-2.pages.dev/>

Documentation can be found in the Doc folder.

The home page does not follow the design in the documentation. This is because the brief implies there is already an existing website.
