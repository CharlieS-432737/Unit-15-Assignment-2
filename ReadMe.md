This is my submission for Unit 15 Assignment 2

The site can be launched by opening a terminal in the src folder. Once a terminal has launched run the following commands:

```bash
    npm install
    npm run dev
```

Or you can visit the site on cloudflare using this link: <https://unit-15-assignment-2.pages.dev/>

The home page does not follow the design in the documention. This is because the breif implies there is already an excisting website.
